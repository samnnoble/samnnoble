            <h2>Photographer at Club One Volleyball</h2>

            <blockquote>I was responsible for attending club volleyball 
                events in different states, where I captured the 
                excitement of high-level matches. This job allowed me 
                to interact with players, coaches, and parents, giving 
                me a deeper understanding of the sport's dynamics. 
                Editing photos for social media and marketing purposes
                 helped showcase the talent and teamwork within the clubs. 
                 It was an amazing experience to be part of this environment,
                  where passion for the game and camaraderie were palpable.</blockquote>

            <h2>Photographer for Corona del Sol Volleyball</h2>

<blockquote>Over the past two years, I've had the privilege of capturing school 
    volleyball rivalries across the state. Travelling to different regions, 
    I've witnessed the intense matchups between schools firsthand. Through 
    my lens, I've captured not just the action on the court but also the 
    passion and pride that define these encounters. Engaging with players, 
    coaches, and supporters has given me a deeper understanding of the 
    significance of these rivalries. Editing photos for social media and 
    marketing has allowed me to share the electric atmosphere of these
     matchups with a broader audience. It's been an enriching experience 
     that has heightened my appreciation for the impact of school sports 
     on communities.</blockquote>
